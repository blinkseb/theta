The subdirectories within this directory contain some realistic
examples for the usage of theta-auto.

To run the examples, change into the subdirectory and execute (from there)
theta-auto.py:

cd $dir
../../theta-auto.py

ks_test:
For the validation of the modeling in a sideband, one can make KS tests or chi^2 tests.
However, if these distributions are affected by shape uncertainties, one should
include them in the comparison. How such a KS-test including shape uncertainties can be
performed with theta-auto is shown here.


zprime:
This is a search for Zprime -> ttbar and is a complete example of a more complex analysis
which 
 * uses more than just one channel
 * uses template morphing to model shpae uncertainties
 * has several independent signal hypotheses, the Zprimes at different masses
The theta-auto script makes limit band plot for expected and observed limits
for Bayesian and CLs limits.

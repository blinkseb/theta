The subdirectories within this directory contain some realistic
examples for the usage of theta-auto.

To run the examples, change into the subdirectory and execute (from there)
theta-auto.py:

cd $dir
../../theta-auto.py

ks_test:
For the validation of the modeling in a sideband, one can make KS tests or chi^2 tests.
However, if these distributions are affected by shape uncertainties, one should
include them in the comparison. How such a KS-test including shape uncertainties can be
performed with theta-auto is shown here.

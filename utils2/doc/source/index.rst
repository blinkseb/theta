theta
=====

``theta`` is a framework for template-based statistical modeling and inference, focussing on problems
in high-energy physics. It provides the possibility for the user to express a "model", i.e.,
the expected data distribution, as function of physical parameters. This model can be used
to make statistical inference about the physical parameter of interest. Modeling is "template-based"
in the sense that the expected data distribution is always expressed as a sum of histograms.

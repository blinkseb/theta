Requirements:
 * should be able to cope with box constraints of parameter naturally




Idea:
 1.The covariance matrix usually has little dependence on the parameter point. Therefore, one
   could use the Hessian of the likelihood for the Asimov dataset as a good initial guess of the actual Hessian
   of another dataset of the same model. This requires extending the minimization interface, which is
   very general currently, e.g. by replacing the "step" parameter with a "step" matrix. This would probably
   also improve the mcmc_minimizer performance.
 2.The priors of the model parameters together with the likelihood of the asimov data could give some
   estimate where the fitted values will be distributed: they will be distributed approximately as
   a multivariate Gaussian around the true value with the covariance from the Asimov likelihood. This
   could be used to better seed the start value / step size for minimization.
 (3.The "little" dependence is probably mainly in the parameter of interest; this dependence could
   be parameterized(?))
